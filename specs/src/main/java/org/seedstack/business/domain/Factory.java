/**
 * A factory is responsible for creating a whole, internally consistent aggregate when it is too
 * complicated to do it in a constructor.
 *
 * <p> A factory is part of the domain and responsible for creating some domain objects. In the
 * business framework a factory can only create domain objects implementing {@link Producible}: </p>
 * <ul> <li>Aggregates through their aggregate root,</li> <li>Value objects,</li> <li>Domain
 * events.</li> </ul> <p> Note that non-root entities are not produced by factories but should be
 * created by their aggregate root. </p>
 *
 * <p> Being responsible for creating valid aggregates, factories may need to create their identity. This can be done
 * from input parameters given to the factory or by using an {@link IdentityGenerator}.</p>
 *
 * <p> Example: </p>
 * <pre>
 * public interface SomeFactory extends Factory&lt;SomeAggregate&gt; {
 *     SomeAggregate createFromName(String name);
 * }
 *
 * public class SomeFactoryImpl implements SomeFactory {
 *     SomeAggregate createFromName(String name) {
 *         // create and return the aggregate
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <P> the type of the produced object.
